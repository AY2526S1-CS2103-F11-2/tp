AuditionNUS is a desktop app for managing auditionee information, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). AuditionNUS is designed for NUS Music Clubs' 
audition organisers who need a fast and reliable way to record, review, and organize auditionee information without 
relying on bulky spreadsheets or manual tracking tools.
